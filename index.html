									<h3>Self-Assessment</h3>
									<p>In this section I will try and semi-objectively evaluate my skills in four main dimension of English lanuage (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking) and point out what I believe to be my strong points, as well as the areas I feel still have room for improvement.</p>
									<div class="features">

												<h4>Listening</h4>
												<p>I think my listening comprehension is good -- most of the university courses I attend are taught in English, and virtually all audiovisual media content I consume (such as films or Youtube videos) is also in English. I can mostly understand the words in the songs I'm listening to (depending on the genre, tempo and sound quality -- for example it can be very hard for me to distinguish words in songs like Venom by Eminem). I can easily hold up a natural conversation in English with a native speaker, unless they speak rapidly in an accent uncommonly found on the internet or academia (e.g. Scottish accent).</p><p>Another thing that I notice about myself is that when I am watching a film without subtitles, I can sometimes zone out or get my rhythm "interrupted" and completely lose the ability to perceive what the characters are saying for a bit, though it varies depending on pronunciation and sound quality in a film -- for example I didn't need subtitles watching High Noon (1952) but found myself sometimes relying on them watching Trainspotting (1996).</p><p>Overall I am confident in my ability to perceive and comprehend audio information, which has increased by a good margin since I've started studying in a university, and I strive to be able to comprehend less clear or complicated (for me) speech in the future.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Reading</h4>
												<p>I believe my reading comprehension to be on a rather high level -- I can fully understand, grasp, and interpret or reformat complex theoretical ideas and tend to prefer more linguistically and structurally challenging reads. I often work with documentation, research papers, and broader theoretical literature (such as philosophical, theological and anthropological book-length works) -- both in academic setting and as a personal interest. <p>Some of my favourite books, however, don't necessarily fully align with abovementioned criteria. Here are some of the works that I believe influenced me the most throughout my life: <i>The Sickness unto Death</i> by Søren Kierkegaard, <i>Walk Through Walls: A Memoir</i> by Marina Abramović, <i>Siddhartha</i>, and <i>Steppenwolf</i> by Hermann Hesse, <i>The Stranger</i> by Albert Camus, <i>Humankind</i> by Rutger Bregman, <i>Silent Spring</i> by Rachel Carson, and virtually the entire Kafka's bibliography as a whole.</p><p>Of course, sometimes I encounter words or idioms that I don't know the meaning of, and then I look them up in a dictionary. Due to my tastes, I imagine I may have a "blind spot" in my vocabulary when it comes to more technical definitions, such as machinery parts or website elements, or less used ways to refer to animals (for example, it was only recently that I'd learned what a mallard is). </p><p>Almost all of the content I consume is in English, reading and looking up any sort of information included, which I believe allows me to actively utilise my English (reading) comprehension skills on a daily basis, as well as helps me build up my vocabulary and other forms of knowledge directly or indirectly related to English -- such as style and format awareness or slang and jargon. I believe my Reading comprehension to be the strongest of the four dimensions, since it's an inherent part of my daily routine and hobbies.</p>

												<h4>Writing</h4>
												<p>Writing is a skill I believe to be the hardest to "passively" train, compared to the other three dimensions. Casual daily writing in my life involves mainly text messaging or information search on the internet, which does not automatically make me a better writer -- albeit a faster one. Undoubtedly, I believe my reading habit to have been greatly supporting my writing skills, but properly applying the vocabulary, style and format knowledge is a challenge in itself. I consider my writing proficiency to be at a level expected of a first-year student, which is far from what I actually want it to be. I am able to put in writing whatever ideas and vision I possess, and I am able to make it structurally pleasant. I utilise a broad vocabulary range in my texts and mind the style I am adhering to, and always try to format the text so that it's easy to read, but there are also aspect I tend to struggle with (namely, when it comes to academia).</p><p>Since the beginning of my studies, I have undertaken a number of courses that aim to enhance the attendees' writing skills, be it in academic, or artistic style. I have also, as a part of my studies, written a fair share of emails, research papers and assignments, all of which helped me to eventually get better in respective styles. If I had to point out my biggest weakness, it would definitely be academic texts which require citations -- not only have I written rather few of such texts, the citation style required was also non-uniform (some professors required MLA, some APA, etc.), which lead to me still having to look up the proper way to cite when writing papers.<p>Writing is currently a skill I am putting the most conscious effort in, and I really want it to pay off -- as I've mentioned in the previous section, research papers fascinate me and I want to eventually become good enough to be able to write them mostly unaided.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Speaking</h4>
												<p>Speaking is definitely among my favourite activities. I am a very sociable and communicative person, and I greatly believe in the power of verbal interpersonal communication. I am not a native of my current country of residence, and while I do speak the local language fluently enough, I will always prefer to communicate in English, which to me sometimes feels even more natural than my native language.</p><p>Most of my university courses are taught in English, which means that even outside of them I have the freedom to communicate with my colleagues in English, allowing me to continuously practice my pronunciation and general speaking skill even in the context of everyday life. I have been attending several courses directly or indirectly related to verbal communication, but I believe that Phonetics & Phonology course has been the most beneficial one so far. Apart from vocabulary, I've realised it's also extremely important to pay attention to pronunciation and general clearness of speech.<p>I can easily hold a natural conversation with a native speaker on a great variety of topics, generally only limited to what I myself am knowledgeable in, since, as I've mentioned earlier, most of the knowledge I possess I obtained in English language. While I am confident in my vocabulary and connectedness of speech, I also have several flaws related to the very process of speaking -- namely, I tend to pronounce sounds like /æ/ and /ɑ:/ in a very similar, nigh indistinguishable manner. Another issue I have and am working on is that when I am talking on a topic I am very fluent in, or retelling a story, I tend to slip into speaking very rapidly, to the point of my words becoming indistinguishable -- something I am also guilty of when speaking in my mother tongue.</p><p>While my speaking manner and vocabulary is much more casual and less thought-out when speaking without preparation, I still believe my speaking proficiency to be of a rather high level, both logically and lingustically.</p>

									<h3>Skills Artefacts</h3>
									<p>Real examples and pieces of information relevant to each of the four English dimensions presented in the previous section, accompanied by my brief reflections.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Listening Examples</h4>
												<div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
													<p>In this section I will showcase the pieces of media comprehension of which required me to rely on my listening skills, then I will evaluate the content and point out the issues or challenges I might have faced.</p>
													<hr></hr>
													<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/mediaviewer/rm2834437120" class="image"><img src="images/trainspotting.png" alt="" /></a>
													<h5>Trainspotting (1996)</h5>
													<div>Trainspotting is easily one of my favourite films -- not only because of its gripping, inspiring, and haunting narrative, but also because of the rich Scottish accent in which this narrative is presented.</div><div>Fun fact about the film is that some scenes had to be re-dubbed because the director deemed the accent to be too strong for overseas audiences!</div><div>I found the toned-down accent of the characters a pleasure to listen to, and could understand most of what they were saying. I think the hardest scene to comprehend was the infamous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcJkLGKl-dU&t=40s">Spud's job interview</a>, where he's all drugged up and Scottish.</div>
													<hr></hr>
													<a href="https://occ-0-8407-92.1.nflxso.net/dnm/api/v6/6AYY37jfdO6hpXcMjf9Yu5cnmO0/AAAABfKOw0IeYm41RxOvx70oYwaA9ONvU7jTcn8I85s1L7M-cri6ttTyVZzvY8cE3rydbBl3OZVgFwLKY-nFABQkFK8p4JXDdrJjtGgP.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/taxidriver.png" alt="" /></a>
													<h5>Taxi Driver (1976)</h5>
													<div>Another one of my favourite films. Here the main character speaks with a mix of a New York and Midwestern English. While the accent is simple enough to understand, the character's narration feels very sedated, sometimes making it hard to distunguish words.</div><div>However, this time I didn't feel like referencing subtitles, and neither do I have any specific scenes in mind that could have caused me any trouble with speech compehension. Good job, Travis!</div>

												<h4>Reading Examples</h4>
												<div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
													<p>In this section I will present some of the most challenging reads I've had, evaluate their content and explain why I felt they were difficult.</p>
													<hr></hr>
													<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sickness_unto_Death#/media/File:The_Sickness_Unto_Death.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/soren.jpg" alt="" /></a>
													<h5>The Sickness unto Death by Søren Kierkegaard</h5>
													<div>A cornerstone of Christian existentialism. This book, written in 1849, explores the author's perception of despair and its forms, as well as presents the phenomenon of despair as the very nature of sin. In this work, Søren outlines the three kinds of despair he believes to exist, as well as the cause and the effect thereof.</div><div>This book is a rather hard read -- it took me close to two months to complete and understand it. The vocabulary used is not too difficult or technical, but it was the structure and the use of language that proved to pose the biggest challenge -- not only did the translators struggled to find suitable modern English substitutions for old Danish definitions, but the author himself was a terrifying writer, easily comparable to Hegel when it came to incomprehensibility.</div><div>Here's one of my favourite quotes from the book:<blockquote>“The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to its own self.”</blockquote></div>
													<hr></hr>
													<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Paradise-Lost-epic-poem-by-Milton#/media/1/442509/119466" class="image"><img src="images/milton.png" alt="" /></a>
													<h5>Paradise Lost by John Milton</h5>
													<div>Another classic of Christian literature -- this time in the form of an epic poem. Published in 1667, it explores themes such as Fall of Man, Satan's rebellion, expulsion from Eden, and a number of other classical Christian narratives -- all in the form of a blank verse. It greatly delves into philosophical themes, the most notable one for me was the concept of human freedom within the Christian framework.</div><div>It was a pretty hard read, not only because of archaic and very poetic use of language and syntax (often uncharacteristic for English), but also because of countless historical references or biblical allusions which I was not familiar with -- I think I had to look up every other verse of the poem, but overall it was a great learning experience for me.<blockquote>“Ill worthy I such title should belong</br>To me transgressor, who for thee ordained</br>A help, became thy snare: to me reproach</br>Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise.”</blockquote></div>

												<h4>Writing Examples</h4>
												<div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
													<p>This section will showcase some of my written works -- either in the form of a free essay, or in the form of an academic writing. I will then try and briefly analyse them from a subjective perspective.</p>
													<hr></hr>
													<iframe src="images/suicide.pdf" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>
													<h5>Sacredness vs. Profanity of Suicide</h5>
													<div>This is a sample of my semi-academic writing in the form of a free essay -- back from when I had just enrolled into the university. I had written it in measly four hours, tighlty before the deadline -- my bewilderment and lack of sleep did end up affecting the structure and language of this text to a certain extent. I also wanted to get to the main body as soon as possible, ending up making the introduction feel pretty rushed, but nonetheless I included this piece because it was by far the most fun I ever had writing an essay. It was my first ever 2000+ word essay as well. If I had time to revise, I would fix up some logical loops and add citations to the work.<div>Overall it was a great experience which helped my to grasp my limits when it came to long-format structure and style support.</div></div>
													<hr></hr>
													<iframe src="images/lgbt.pdf" width="100%" height="550px"></iframe>
													<h5>LGBT Right Awareness in Wartime Ukraine</h5>
													<div>This is an example of my academic writing on a relevant societal issue, in which I used APA style citation for the first time in my life. This is a very short essay about the ways in which the war might affect the local LGBT community, with real examples. I used a pretty standard language, with a personal approach -- as per the assignment I was presented with.<div>Writing this essay provided me with a good introduction on how to use citations, as well as how to properly research all my information and back my claims in academic environment.</div></div>
